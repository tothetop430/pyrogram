        It's a shortcut for:

        - Clicking inline buttons:

        .. code-block:: python

            client.request_callback_answer(
                chat_id=message.chat.id,

                callback_data=message.reply_markup[i][j].callback_data
            )

        - Clicking normal buttons:

        .. code-block:: python

            client.send_message(
                chat_id=message.chat.id,
                text=message.reply_markup[i][j].text
            )

        This method can be used in three different ways:

        1.  Pass one integer argument only (e.g.: ``.click(2)``, to click a button at index 2).
            Buttons are counted left to right, starting from the top.

        2.  Pass two integer arguments (e.g.: ``.click(1, 0)``, to click a button at position (1, 0)).
            The origin (0, 0) is top-left.

        3.  Pass one string argument only (e.g.: ``.click("Settings")``, to click a button by using its label).
            Only the first matching button will be pressed.

        Args:
            x (``int`` | ``str``):
                Used as integer index, integer abscissa (in pair with y) or as string label.

            y (``int``, *optional*):
                Used as ordinate only (in pair with x).

            quote (``bool``, *optional*):
                Useful for normal buttons only, where pressing it will result in a new message sent.
                If ``True``, the message will be sent as a reply to this message.
                Defaults to ``True`` in group chats and ``False`` in private chats.

        Returns:
            -   The result of *request_callback_answer()* in case of inline callback button clicks.
            -   The result of *reply()* in case of normal button clicks.
            -   A string in case the inline button is an URL, switch_inline_query or switch_inline_query_current_chat
                button.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>`
            ``ValueError``: If the provided index or position is out of range or the button label was not found
            ``TimeoutError``: If, after clicking an inline button, the bot fails to answer within 10 seconds
