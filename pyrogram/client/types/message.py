            Messages received from other chats are incoming (*outgoing* is False).
            Messages sent from yourself to other chats are outgoing (*outgoing* is True).
            An exception is made for your own personal chat; messages sent there will be incoming.

        matches (``list``, *optional*):
            A list containing all `Match Objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects>`_ that match
