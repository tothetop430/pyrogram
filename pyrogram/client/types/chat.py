class Chat(Object):
    """This object represents a chat.

    Args:
        id (``int``):
            Unique identifier for this chat. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming
            languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it is smaller than 52 bits,
            so a signed 64 bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.

        type (``str``):
            Type of chat, can be either "private", "group", "supergroup" or "channel".

        title (``str``, *optional*):

        last_name (``str``, *optional*):
            Last name of the other party in a private chat.

        all_members_are_administrators (``bool``, *optional*):
            True if a group has 'All Members Are Admins' enabled.

        photo (:obj:`ChatPhoto <pyrogram.ChatPhoto>`, *optional*):
            Chat photo. Returned only in getChat.

        description (``str``, *optional*):

        invite_link (``str``, *optional*):

        pinned_message (:obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>`, *optional*):
            Pinned message, for supergroups and channel chats. Returned only in getChat.
