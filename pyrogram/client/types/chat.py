    """This object represents a chat.

    Attributes:

    Args:
        id (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Unique identifier for this chat. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it is smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.

            Type of chat, can be either "private", "group", "supergroup" or "channel".

        title (``str``, optional):

        last_name (``str``, optional):
            Last name of the other party in a private chat.

        all_members_are_administrators (``bool``, optional):
            True if a group has 'All Members Are Admins' enabled.

        photo (:obj:`ChatPhoto <pyrogram.types.ChatPhoto>`, optional):
            Chat photo. Returned only in getChat.
