class CallbackQuery(Object):
    """This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an inline keyboard.
    If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field message
    will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in inline mode),
    the field inline_message_id will be present. Exactly one of the fields data or game_short_name will be present.

    Args:
        id (``str``):
            Unique identifier for this query.

        from_user (:obj:`User <pyrogram.User>`):
            Sender.

        chat_instance (``str``, *optional*):
            Message with the callback button that originated the query. Note that message content and message date will
            not be available if the message is too old.

        message (:obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>`, *optional*):
            Identifier of the message sent via the bot in inline mode, that originated the query.

        inline_message_id (``str``):
            Global identifier, uniquely corresponding to the chat to which the message with the callback button was
            sent. Useful for high scores in games.

        data (``str``, *optional*):
            Data associated with the callback button. Be aware that a bad client can send arbitrary data in this field.

        game_short_name (``str``, *optional*):
            Short name of a Game to be returned, serves as the unique identifier for the game.
