        """Use this method to download the media from a Message.

        Args:
            message (:obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>` | ``str``):
                Pass a Message containing the media, the media itself (message.audio, message.video, ...) or
                the file id as string.

            file_name (``str``, *optional*):
                A custom *file_name* to be used instead of the one provided by Telegram.
                By default, all files are downloaded in the *downloads* folder in your working directory.
                You can also specify a path for downloading files in a custom location: paths that end with "/"
                are considered directories. All non-existent folders will be created automatically.

            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the file has been downloaded.
                Defaults to True.

            progress (``callable``):
                Pass a callback function to view the download progress.
                The function must take *(client, current, total, \*args)* as positional arguments (look at the section
                below for a detailed description).

            progress_args (``tuple``):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function. Useful, for example, if you want to pass
                a chat_id and a message_id in order to edit a message with the updated progress.

        Other Parameters:
            client (:obj:`Client <pyrogram.Client>`):
                The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the callback function.

            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes downloaded so far.

            total (``int``):
                The size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the *progress_args* parameter.
                You can either keep *\*args* or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the absolute path of the downloaded file as string is returned, None otherwise.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>`
