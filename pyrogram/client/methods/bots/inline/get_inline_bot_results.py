        You can then send a result using :obj:`send_inline_bot_result <pyrogram.Client.send_inline_bot_result>`

        Args:
            bot (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier of the inline bot you want to get results from. You can specify
                a @username (str) or a bot ID (int).

            query (``str``):
                Text of the query (up to 512 characters).

            offset (``str``):
                Offset of the results to be returned.

            location (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Your location in tuple format (latitude, longitude), e.g.: (51.500729, -0.124583).
                Useful for location-based results only.

        Returns:
            On Success, :obj:`BotResults <pyrogram.api.types.messages.BotResults>` is returned.
