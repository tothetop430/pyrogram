        This is a utility method intended to be used only when working with Raw Functions (i.e: a Telegram API method
        you wish to use which is not available yet in the Client class as an easy-to-use method), whenever an InputPeer
        type is required.

        Args:
            peer_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                The peer id you want to extract the InputPeer from.
                Can be a direct id (int), a username (str) or a phone number (str).

        Returns:
            On success, the resolved peer id is returned in form of an InputPeer object.

        Raises:
