        You can get up to 100 messages at once.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                For a private channel/supergroup you can use its *t.me/joinchat/* link.

            offset (``int``, *optional*)
                Sequential number of the first message to be returned.
                Defaults to 0 (most recent message).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, the first 100 messages are returned.

            offset_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a message identifier as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that message.

            offset_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a date in Unix time as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that date.

        Returns:
            On success, a :obj:`Messages <pyrogram.Messages>` object is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>`
