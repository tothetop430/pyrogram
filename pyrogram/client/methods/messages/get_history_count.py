        """Get the total count of messages in a chat.

        .. note::

            Due to Telegram latest internal changes, the server can't reliably find anymore the total count of messages
            a **private** or a **basic group** chat has with a single method call. To overcome this limitation, Pyrogram
            has to iterate over all the messages. Channels and supergroups are not affected by this limitation.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

        Returns:
            ``int``: On success, the chat history count is returned.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
