        You can retrieve up to 200 messages at once.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``iterable``, *optional*):
                Pass a single message identifier or a list of message ids (as integers) to get the content of the
                message themselves. Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            reply_to_message_ids (``iterable``, *optional*):
                Pass a single message identifier or a list of message ids (as integers) to get the content of
                the previous message you replied to using this message. Iterators and Generators are also accepted.
                If *message_ids* is set, this argument will be ignored.

            replies (``int``, *optional*):
                The number of subsequent replies to get for each message. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            On success and in case *message_ids* or *reply_to_message_ids* was a list, the returned value will be a
            list of the requested :obj:`Messages <pyrogram.Messages>` even if a list contains just one element,
            otherwise if *message_ids* or *reply_to_message_ids* was an integer, the single requested
            :obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>` is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
