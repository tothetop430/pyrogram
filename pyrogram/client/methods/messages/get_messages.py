        """Use this method to get messages that belong to a specific chat.
        You can retrieve up to 200 messages at once.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                For a private channel/supergroup you can use its *t.me/joinchat/* link.

            message_ids (``iterable``):
                A list of Message identifiers in the chat specified in *chat_id* or a single message id, as integer.
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            replies (``int``, *optional*):
                The number of subsequent replies to get for each message. Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            On success and in case *message_ids* was a list, the returned value will be a list of the requested
            :obj:`Messages <pyrogram.Message>` even if a list contains just one element, otherwise if
            *message_ids* was an integer, the single requested :obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>`
            is returned.
