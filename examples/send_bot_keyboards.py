"""This example will show you how to send normal and inline keyboards.

You must log-in as a regular bot in order to send keyboards (use the token from @BotFather).
Any attempt in sending keyboards with a user account will be simply ignored by the server.

send_message() is used as example, but a keyboard can be sent with any other send_* methods,
like send_audio(), send_document(), send_location(), etc...
