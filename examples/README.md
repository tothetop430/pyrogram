# Examples

This folder contains example scripts to show you how **Pyrogram** looks like.
You can start with [hello_world.py](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/blob/master/examples/hello_world.py) and continue
with the more advanced examples.

Every script is working right away (provided you correctly set up your credentials), meaning
you can simply copy-paste and run, the only things you have to change are your session names and the target chats
