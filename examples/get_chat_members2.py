"""This is an improved version of get_chat_members.py

Since Telegram will return at most 10.000 members for a single query, this script
repeats the search using numbers ("0" to "9") and all the available ascii letters ("a" to "z").

This can be further improved by also searching for non-ascii characters (e.g.: Japanese script),
as some user names may not contain ascii letters at all.
