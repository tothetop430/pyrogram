Usage
=====

Having your `project set up`_ and your account authorized_, it's time to play with the API.
In this section, you'll be shown two ways of communicating with Telegram using Pyrogram. Let's start!

High-level API
--------------

The easiest and recommended way to interact with Telegram is via the high-level Pyrogram methods_ and types_, which are
named after the `Telegram Bot API`_.

Examples (more on `GitHub <https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/tree/develop/examples>`_):

-   Get information about the authorized user:

    .. code-block:: python

        print(app.get_me())

-   Send a message to yourself (Saved Messages):

    .. code-block:: python

        app.send_message("me", "Hi there! I'm using Pyrogram")

-   Upload a new photo (with caption):

    .. code-block:: python

        app.send_photo("me", "/home/dan/perla.jpg", "Cute!")

Raw Functions
-------------

If you can't find a high-level method for your needs or if want complete, low-level access to the whole Telegram API,
you have to use the raw :mod:`functions <pyrogram.api.functions>` and :mod:`types <pyrogram.api.types>` exposed by the
``pyrogram.api`` package and call any Telegram API method you wish using the :meth:`send() <pyrogram.Client.send>`
method provided by the Client class.

.. hint:: Every high-level method mentioned in the section above is built on top of these raw functions.

    Nothing stops you from using the raw functions only, but they are rather complex and `plenty of them`_ are already
    re-implemented by providing a much simpler and cleaner interface which is very similar to the Bot API.

    If you think a raw function should be wrapped and added as a high-level method, feel free to ask in our Community_!

Examples (more on `GitHub <https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/tree/develop/examples>`_):

-   Update first name, last name and bio:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram import Client
        from pyrogram.api import functions

        app = Client("my_account")
        app.start()

        app.send(
            functions.account.UpdateProfile(
                first_name="Dan", last_name="TÃ¨s",
                about="Bio written from Pyrogram"
            )
        )

        app.stop()

-   Share your Last Seen time only with your contacts:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram import Client
        from pyrogram.api import functions, types

        app = Client("my_account")
        app.start()

        app.send(
            functions.account.SetPrivacy(
                key=types.InputPrivacyKeyStatusTimestamp(),
                rules=[types.InputPrivacyValueAllowContacts()]
            )
        )

        app.stop()

-   Invite users to your channel/supergroup:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram import Client
        from pyrogram.api import functions, types

        app = Client("my_account")
        app.start()

        app.send(
            functions.channels.InviteToChannel(
                channel=app.resolve_peer(123456789),  # ID or Username
                users=[  # The users you want to invite
                    app.resolve_peer(23456789),  # By ID
                    app.resolve_peer("username"),  # By username
                    app.resolve_peer("393281234567"),  # By phone number
                ]
            )
        )

        app.stop()
