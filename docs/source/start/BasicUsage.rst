Basic Usage
===========

.. note::

    All the snippets below assume you have successfully created and started a :class:`Client <pyrogram.Client>`
    instance. You also must be authorized, that is, a valid *.session file does exist in your working directory.

Simple API Access
-----------------

The easiest way to interact with the Telegram API is via the :class:`Client <pyrogram.Client>` class,
which exposes bot-like_ methods. The purpose of this Client class is to make it even simpler to work with the
API by abstracting the raw functions listed in the schema.

The result is a much cleaner interface that allows you to:

-   Get information about the authorized user:

    .. code-block:: python

        print(client.get_me())

-   Send a message to yourself (Saved Messages):

    .. code-block:: python

        client.send_message("me", "Hi there! I'm using Pyrogram")

-   Upload a photo (with caption):

    .. code-block:: python

        client.send_photo("me", "/home/dan/perla.jpg", "Cute!")

.. seealso:: For a complete list of the available methods have a look at the :class:`Client <pyrogram.Client>` class.

Using Raw Functions
-------------------

If you want **complete**, low-level access to the Telegram API you have to use the raw
:mod:`functions <pyrogram.api.functions>` and :mod:`types <pyrogram.api.types>` exposed by the ``pyrogram.api``
package and call any Telegram API method you wish using the :meth:`send() <pyrogram.Client.send>` method provided by
the Client class.

Here some examples:

-   Update first name, last name and bio:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram.api import functions

        ...

        client.send(
            functions.account.UpdateProfile(
                first_name="Dan", last_name="TÃ¨s",
                about="Bio written from Pyrogram"
            )
        )

-   Share your Last Seen time only with your contacts:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram.api import functions, types

        ...

        client.send(
            functions.account.SetPrivacy(
                key=types.InputPrivacyKeyStatusTimestamp(),
                rules=[types.InputPrivacyValueAllowContacts()]
            )
        )

-   Invite users to your channel/supergroup:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram.api import functions, types

        ...

        client.send(
            functions.channels.InviteToChannel(
                channel=client.resolve_peer(123456789),  # ID or Username
                users=[  # The users you want to invite
                    client.resolve_peer(23456789),  # By ID
                    client.resolve_peer("username"),  # By username
                    client.resolve_peer("393281234567"),  # By phone number
                ]
            )
        )
