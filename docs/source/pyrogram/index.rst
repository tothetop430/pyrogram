Pyrogram
========

In this section you can find a detailed description of the Pyrogram API.

:class:`Client <pyrogram.Client>` is the main class you have to deal with.
You will notice that methods are named after the well established `Telegram Bot API`_ and that most of them accept
the same parameters as well, thus offering a familiar look to Bot developers.
