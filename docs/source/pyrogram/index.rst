In this section you can find a detailed description of the Pyrogram package and its high-level API.

:class:`Client <pyrogram.Client>` is the main class. It exposes easy-to-use methods that are named
after the well established `Telegram Bot API`_ methods, thus offering a familiar look to Bot developers.
