Release Notes
=============

Release notes for Pyrogram releases will describe what's new in each version, and will also make you aware of any
backwards-incompatible changes made in that version.

When upgrading to a new version of Pyrogram, you will need to check all the breaking changes in order to find
incompatible code in your application, but also to take advantage of new features and improvements.

.. note::

    Currently, all Pyrogram release notes live inside the GitHub repository web page:
    https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/releases.
